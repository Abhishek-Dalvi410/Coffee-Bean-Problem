# Coffee-Bean-Problem

- Consider a coffee can containing an arbitrary (but finite) number of beans.
- Initially the can is non-empty. 
- The beans come in 3 different colors: red, green, and blue.
- Initially the can is not empty. 
- You are asked to perform the following action repeatedly (ie., over and over as long as possible):
- Reach into the can and pick two random beans.
  --> If the beans are the same color, throw them both out.
  --> If they are different colors (eg., red and green), throw them both out and 
      add a bean of the third color (eg., blue) to the can.
 

Safety and Progress property are shown in the program and proven in the pdf.
